# Creating 1 Player Dice Game

Challenge set was to create a HTML Dice game using Javascript and the DOM to make the game interactive. The rules of the game included:
* Roll the dice to begin the game
* Dice appears on the first roll
* When a dice is rolled the score adds up
* Once the score pased 20 you win
* If you hit 1 you loose
* If the player won or lose the player can start the game again


# What I liked
* Really enjoyed visually seeing the game come to life and being interactive using the DOM
* Enjoyed learning to debug in the console - usually it was just spelling mistakes which stopped my code from running
* In particular enjoyed working on the styling as feel this is one of my strengths and tried to match the challenge styling exactly

# What I didn't like
* Struggled with the logic in javascipt of building the actual game and at this stage need alot of pointers of what is required/bringing it all together


# What need to work on
* Need to practise on creating other games where 'logic' is required


# next steps
* looking to up the game by make it a two player game using 'toggle'
